# SlackEmojis

Some emoji exports and a script to simplify downloading them.

### Using download.sh

1. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  On OSX this can be done via `brew install jq`.  Distributions for various flavors of linux should also be available.  Windows users should first upgrade their OS
2. Download the `download.sh` script
3. `cd [place you downloaded it to`
4. `chmod +x download.sh`
5. `./download.sh`
6. Follow the prompts.  You can generate a legacy slack token [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
7. Enjoy
